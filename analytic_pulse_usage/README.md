# Examples of how to use APT

The following examples are provided for the interested user. These examples cover the cases discussed in Ref 1 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04843).

Note: some of these examples can be fairly computationally expensive.

## Benchmarking examples

### Vacuum implementation (APT_VACUUM)

Files: input decks labeled `vacuum_plane1D` and figure 

### Plasma (analytic current) implementation (APT_PLASMA)

Files: input decks labeled 'plasma_plane1D' and 'plasma_ramp1D' and figure

### Scaling (APT_VACUUM)

Files: input decks labeled `vacuum_plane1D` and figure


## Examples for applications of APT
